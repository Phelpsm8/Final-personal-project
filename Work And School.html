				<p>I have been working from when i turned 16. 
				My first job was as a busser at the Fort Mitchell Public House. This was a very good job and i liked it very much but the Corona virus had forced them to cut doiwn on staff for almost a year.
				This brings me to my second job at amazon as a truck unloader at a sorting center. This is also a good job and i hope to be moving to Amazon site IT once i graduate. 
				I have also worked on and off with a company in Cincinati that does trade shows. This has given me many opprotunities to travel to several US cities including Las Vegas, Chicago, Indianapolis and Orlando</p>
